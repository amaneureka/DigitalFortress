# DigitalFortress
As a part of Innovision’s boggling bonanza of competitions, IEEE NSIT presents to you, Digital Fortress - The Online Hacking Event!   Digital Fortress will consist of a series of questions of increasing difficulty level whereby you’ll be required to gather the hints, put your mind on roll and decode the answers to qualify for the further hacks.   Here’s a shout out to all school and college students to buckle up and gear their intellect. Digital Fortress is here to take you by storm!   The platform for the event will be live soon! Stay tuned to us for updates.
